# matlabSudokuSolver
Simple Matlab sudoku solver written in MATLAB. The Sudoku problem gets solved by simply checking whether or not one of the numbers 1-9 can be written or if it already exists in either its corresponding row, column or box. 

This code does not solve every possible Sudoku problem, but is a very good start. In order to solve every possible problem out there, I will write a brute force algorithm in the near future.
